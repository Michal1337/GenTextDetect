      "\n",
      "Content: \"As we age and accumulate life experiences, we often reach a point where we understand that life is a journey. This realization is beautifully captured in The Hours, where Meryl Streep's character says, 'I thought that was the beginning of happiness, and it wasn't; that was happiness.' This suggests that happiness is not a destination to be reached, but rather a part of the journey itself. It encompasses a range of emotions, from great sadness to immense joy. The wisdom of this understanding often comes with age, and it's something we wish we could grasp earlier in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my own life, I've found that happiness is not something to wait for, but something to be found in the present moment. It's about accepting and appreciating what we have, and understanding that even if things don't get better, that's still happiness. This is a difficult concept to grasp and even harder to live by, but it's a valuable perspective to have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, I had a peaceful weekend at home while my partner was camping. I had planned to do a lot of cooking and reading, but instead found myself doing dishes, sleeping, and spending time with my parents. It was a nice change of pace, and I enjoyed the quiet time.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, not everything was peaceful. My parents are upset because they've been annexed into the city of Rockford, which means they'll have to pay higher taxes. They're considering selling their property, but my dad has come up with a potential solution: donating the house to the church with a provision that they can live there until retirement or death. This could provide a tax deduction and relieve them of property taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these challenges, I had a nice weekend. I slept in, cooked a delicious meal, and caught up on the news. I also finished reading two-part invention, a book that deeply moved me. I'm looking forward to starting Circle of Quiet, the first in the Crosswicks Journals series.\n",

There are people who appear perfectly normal at first glance, engaging in lively conversations and social outings, but once the casual chat begins to delve into humor, sarcasm, or meaningful exchanges, they can suddenly reveal a startling lack of personality.  To an onlooker, these individuals might not seem like candidates for dull conversations; they have lives, friends, and social engagements.  Yet, when it comes to sparking real connections or adding a touch of wit to a discussion, they fall short.

      "In retrospect, the discovery that one of the most entertaining comedians I've encountered, Drake Sather, has tragically passed away more than four months ago, leaves me deeply saddened. Drake's self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head is a heart-wrenching reality that can't be adequately expressed in words. Reflecting on this, I recall a pivotal moment from my adolescent years, around the age of 12 or 13, during those prolonged weekends. Given that I was an only child, the sole kid my age within my immediate vicinity, and perceived as a quiet individual in school, these weekends were often filled with solitude. To combat this loneliness, I would engage in activities like watching videos, reading, or penning my own narratives. By midnight, if these pursuits lost their appeal (typically around 3:30 AM), I'd switch on the TV in the living room. \n",

This fear of the number 13, known as triskaidekaphobia, was so strong among the Turks that they almost eliminated it from their language (Brewer, 1894). Many cities avoid naming streets or avenues with the number 13, and numerous buildings skip the 13th floor. Interestingly, having 13 letters in your name is believed to bring the devil's luck; notable figures like Jack the Ripper, Charles Manson, Jeffrey Dahmer, Lisa Sheffield, Theodore Bundy, and Albert De Salvo all share this trait.

Why choose me over countless attractive people worldwide?  I found myself sliding down a rabbit hole of endless possibilities and distant galaxies.  I had to touch my forehead to ground myself back in reality.  I chuckled at the thought of a new friendship with Mia Hartley.  I pictured us exchanging funny messages and joking around.  I imagined she lived somewhere in Europe, maybe Paris.  I visualized her with blonde hair, a chic black dress, and designer sunglasses.  We would visit each other in our respective cities.  I would introduce her to my friends and say, 'This is my new best friend, Mia Hartley.'  My friends would be envious, of course.  They don't know anyone with a name that sounds like a celebrity.  In reality, she was just trying to sell me some expensive skincare products.  It's nice of her to offer, but I don't need more skincare.  It could have been interesting.

According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, disease rates remain high, and the immune system's response to the virus varies among individuals. The presence of antibodies in some individuals does not guarantee immunity, and the immune system's effectiveness can be compromised by factors such as age and pre-existing health conditions. Experts also emphasize the importance of continued public health measures, including the use of masks and social distancing, which are supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

      "Salient object detection (SOD) is a critical task in computer vision, aiming to identify and segment the most attention-grabbing objects in an image. Traditional methods often rely on hand-crafted features and shallow models, which struggle to capture complex visual patterns. In this paper, we introduce DeepSaliency, a multi-task deep neural network model designed to enhance the performance of SOD by leveraging the power of deep learning. DeepSaliency employs a shared backbone network to extract rich feature representations, followed by task-specific branches for saliency prediction and auxiliary tasks such as edge detection and depth estimation. The integration of these tasks allows the model to learn more discriminative features, improving its ability to distinguish salient objects from the background. We propose a novel loss function that combines the losses from each task, encouraging the network to learn complementary information. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepSaliency outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and robustness. Our results highlight the effectiveness of multi-task learning in enhancing salient object detection, paving the way for more advanced and reliable computer vision applications.\n",

      "\n",
      "Abstract:\n",
      "This paper introduces a novel technique for enhancing the perceptual consistency in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), aiming to improve the visual realism and coherence of generated images. The method leverages the Normalised Laplacian Pyramid Distance (NLPD), a metric designed to assess the perceptual similarity between images more effectively than traditional pixel-based distances. The core innovation lies in integrating the NLPD into the training process of GANs, ensuring that the generated outputs not only match the statistical properties of the training data but also maintain a high level of visual fidelity and consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Normalised Laplacian Pyramid Distance works by decomposing images into multiple levels of detail, from coarse to fine, using a pyramid structure. This decomposition emphasizes the importance of various frequency components, allowing for a more nuanced comparison of images that captures both global and local visual features. By normalizing this distance measure, the technique ensures that the comparison is invariant to the overall intensity levels, focusing instead on the structural and perceptual aspects that are crucial for image realism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The integration of NLPD into GAN training is achieved through a modified loss function that guides the generator to produce images that not only match the distribution of the training dataset but also adhere to the perceptual characteristics encoded in the NLPD. This results in a more robust and versatile GAN model capable of generating high-quality, perceptually consistent images that closely mimic real-world scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The significance of this research lies in its potential to advance the field of image synthesis and computer vision, offering a practical solution for enhancing the realism of generated content in applications such as image-to-image translation, image editing, and content creation. The use of NLPD not only improves the visual quality of GAN outputs but also opens up new avenues for evaluating and optimizing generative models based on human-perceived quality, rather than solely on statistical similarity.\n",

      "[\"It's 8:05, and I feel like I'm on the edge of my seat, waiting for the clock to tick. Yeah, seriously, that's what I just said. Why is my roommate interrupting me? She knows I'm working on this assignment. Ugh, that was really irritating. I'm not sure if I meant my roommate or myself. Sometimes, I think I don't understand half of what I say, even though I didn't actually say that. I just lost my train of thought because she spoke to me again. Blah, blah, blah. Why do I do that? Anyway, I want to have more dreams. Really intense ones where I don't want to wake up; like the one I had when I was a kid, with these lonely French 12-year-olds in it, and I was standing outside their house window or something. They remind me of the mafia and the untouchables; my secret song that I swear is about the untouchables. I wish I knew what song it was. That would be amazing. I wonder if I'm overthinking my friend's 'coming out'. Like, I'm okay with it, and most people are okay with it, but I might be trying to sound TOO okay with it. I don't know. My roommate's parents don't seem to like me, but I'm not entirely sure, so I shouldn't even think that, let alone say it. Or write it. Aren't I supposed to be typing about my feelings? Okay, I feel like I keep trying to prove myself to my friend Angela, just because she is so amazing and I don't feel too amazing myself a lot of the time. But I don't try to prove myself to her; I did to my friend Ali, but not to Angela. I don't even know what I'm talking about right now. I hate that; I'll think something about someone just because I had thought it about someone else. And I don't know if that's bad or good or whatever. I'm typing too much too fast; I keep getting myself confused and backspacing. I wonder if I should just leave all the misspellings in here; it might make sense so far as the paper goes, since maybe that would suggest that my mind's confused and jumbled, the way handwriting is supposed to tell about you, but I don't know at all. Cause we're supposed to correct our misspellings. The Buddy Holly song is in my head. Does that mean I should sing it to the paper since it's in my head and whatever's in my head should be going down here? No, I don't think so; it's kind of like background music; jazz to Kerouac type of thing. I wonder if I'm as important to Grant as he is to me. That goes with all my friends. He should be here soon; no tape for me. This makes no sense, I'm sure; I sound terrible, like Adrian Mole, except for I keep criticizing myself as Adrian keeps complimenting himself. My back hurts; I wonder if my doctor who I went to once was right when I said I was going to have neck and back problems later, just because I don't have the greatest posture in the world. I mean, my philosophy professor said today that if pleasure is virtue then he was virtuous in smoking, and he wasn't lying, but I don't think that there is any virtue in slouching. Is this what first-person books are supposed to be like? Cause characters would never be able to write this much; no, what I meant was that it would sound dumb and pointless and rambling like this, unless they had some superb, Staten Island computer guy like mind. Like that last reference wouldn't make any sense at all to anyone but me; in books they describe it. I don't know. Like Kerouac I guess. Bless you. There, I said it in response to my roommate's sneeze on here at least. I don't think of her as Elizabeth, cause she's not, she's my roommate. Elizabeth's a dead girl who used to laugh at a camping trip where she got sick on the day of a campout; no a bonfire; who used to like peanut butter. Elizabeth did, not the peanut butter. Why is everyone homesick (or my roommate)? I'm not; I want to talk to my cat though. He's going to hate me when I get home. Like, it'll be like when my mom took him into surgery and he would run away from her. I hope he doesn't die. I'm missing all of the little things in between these thoughts; the thoughts I have while I'm typing. I would try to type those things too, but then there would be things while I was typing that. I hate paper, I miss trees. There goes my roommate complaining again. But I'll stop, cause she might come over and read over my shoulder or something and I'll have to stop like I did the first time I tried to do this exercise; that was horrible, it was only 2 minutes into it, but still. But she came close to here, and I don't know. Good, she's on the phone now. I'm staring at the little monitor light on my computer; it looks like some alien symbol for sex or something; I don't know what I'm thinking (tip of the tongue) but it's weird whatever it is. I want to be in Rocky Horror. I wonder what it's like to be in it; just in the movie, not the little plays during it. Yesssssssss, noooooooooooo. I don't know. It's 8:22. Why the hell did I type yessssssssss? Remember on the Wonder Years, and they would have to go to typing class; that's what I think my mom's childhood was like. My lips feel like they're about to fall apart if I smile again; not because I've been smiling too much, because they're really chapped along the edges. Two minutes left. Yess. I did it again. I want to go out to breakfast; real breakfast, with eggs and pancakes you don't have to tear apart with your teeth to cut. I'm looking at my chopsticks now; I wonder why people are so fascinated with them, why I brought them, I don't know at all. And I'm feeling bad about having a good luck elephant made out of ivory, cause doesn't that go against the good luck of elephants? \"]\n",

      "I don't know where to start. I feel betrayed. Betrayed by a friend I valued. I don't understand how it happened, but I know that things will never be the same again. I once thought college would bring us closer, but I've discovered that no matter where we are, my friend is a million miles away. I used to think I could get through to him, but I guess I was wrong. My friends say he's a part of the past, and I should look to the future, but right now, I think he just breaks my heart. Perhaps I'm thinking too much about this. I just need to get over it. Until I do, I won't be able to connect with others because I'm not reachable right now. My friends warned me this would happen, but, as usual, I wouldn't listen. I just can't help it; I want to do things my way. Do I understand myself? No. Sometimes I think I'm a total psycho and I've surprised people with how well I scare them off. I've met some nice people, but I'm not open for new friends right now, which is such a bad idea at this point in my life. Well, it's not that I'm not open to making new friends; it's that I have to let go of the past before I can pursue anything else. The trouble is that I know my friend isn't thinking about this as much as I am. Perhaps that's what hurts me the most. Just knowing that our friendship meant more to me than to him. I talk to his friend, and his friend says to give it time. I'm trying, I swear. I'm entirely too emotional about these things, I guess. I miss my best friends. I need someone to talk to. I'm not sure about this whole sorority thing, but maybe I'll find my friends there. Who knows? Thank God all those girls don't fit the sorority stereotype. That would be hell. But some of them are actually very cool. That makes me feel better because when I first met them all, I was scared shitless. I was so afraid, I almost cried. Sometimes I think about what I'm getting myself into, and I get scared again, but not like that. I've never been scared like that. This such a scary place for me right now. Maybe if I felt secure with my friends. I just think that this one guy will never really talk to me again, and it bothers me a lot. I just need to find something else to occupy my time. I really think he thinks I'm a psycho. I've got to stop thinking about this. Remember what Ashley said: don't try to force things, if it's meant to be, it will happen. I'm trying to keep that in mind, Ash. I guess everything is up to God at this point. It's all a matter of trust. At times, I'm just not willing to let someone else handle it. I've just got to let go. of everything. This guy is not the only thing I've been worrying about. I worry about my best friends. All of us at different schools. I think about what they're doing and if they're drunk right now or scared. Sometimes I worry about myself. I have a low self-esteem, which sounds strange but I think I like it. Not liking myself. I think, in a way, it keeps you from getting arrogant. But on the other hand, maybe that, too, is a different kind of arrogance. Thinking about yourself all the time, whether it's good or bad. Why can't I reach you? Where are you? I've got to stop thinking about things. The trouble with me is that I don't obsess over many things, but the ones I do, it's often and it totally eats away at my life. It can kill me pieces at a time. I've lost my appetite and sometimes my desire to go out. But when I'm sitting there, holed up in my room feeling sorry for myself, I know that the rest of the world is moving on without me. Especially here, at college. Matchbox 20 is on the radio. That song really \"Push\" really hits me. Some songs make me cry if they fit a particularly depressing aspect of my life well enough. I want to connect with other people the way that song connects with me. I just need to keep an open mind and get out there and do it. Carey told me once that I need to get off my butt and do things because I'm not always going to get an invitation. This reminds me of Tim off in Colorado. I'm so glad Patch called to see if I could come home for Tim's birthday. I guess the relief lies in the security that comes from anything associated with Pre-college. But I wouldn't go back if I could. I was the one of my friends saying how excited I was to leave. And I was. I'm glad I'm here, but now that I'm here, I don't know what to do. I really like this stream of consciousness stuff, and this isn't because I'm trying to kiss butt or anything; it's just that I write a lot of stuff like this to let off steam. It's my own form of closure for the problems in my life. I'm thinking about going into journalism, but who knows? I was the FBI last week. I think if you don't have anyone to talk to, you have to at least write things down. I'm starting to be friends with Brian. I hope we get to be good friends. The trouble with college is that people all know that everyone needs friends, but you can't be best friends with everyone. The friend that you find that you really relate to is rare. I'm still searching. I feel like I'm Holden Caulfield in Catcher. That kills me.\n",

Unlike high school, where you only need to pay attention in class to succeed, college demands a lot more from students. In high school, if you took notes in class, you were set. However, in college, even when teachers teach different topics in class, the core information is usually found in the textbooks.

      "I must admit that Austin has a certain familiarity to it, akin to my previous experiences in Houston. This was not what I had envisioned when I enrolled at UT. Nonetheless, I am striving to make the most of my college experience here, hoping to uncover the unexpected joys that it can bring. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, I'm pleasantly surprised by the vibrant and diverse girl population at UT. I find myself enjoying their company and discovering facets of college life that I never knew existed.

      "Usually, when you know you have something to do, you find yourself thinking about it and asking, \"How am I going to do this? Where should I begin? Where will I end up? How do I know I'm doing it right?\" That's exactly what I'm feeling with this writing assignment. It's mid-week, and the weekend is almost here. I'm eager for Saturday because I'll be going to my first UT football game of the season. It happens to be my first game ever, which I'm excited about. Time seems to crawl by in the fall semester, much slower than when I attended summer school. It’s exhausting. Labor Day is this weekend, and I'm really looking forward to the four-day break and some rest. Maybe I'll even visit Brett in College Station; he's a friend from El Paso. The drive, however, is a real pain. Last weekend, Lianne and I went on a road trip to visit him. It was somewhat enjoyable, despite the rudeness of the people there, which I find quite irritating. They’re overly focused on belittling UT or \"TU\" as they like to call it, since we're not \"THE\" University of Texas but \"A\" Texas University. It's ridiculous, but I admit I'm still upset about how they damaged the horns on my car's longhorn emblem. It's sad how immaturity can take over. They do have plenty of school spirit, though, making me wish I shared their enthusiasm. Maybe when all the football games start, I'll see just how crazy the Longhorns can get. I'm also eagerly anticipating the softball games. I'd love to watch all their home games to understand what it takes to be on the team. Hopefully, with hard work and practice next year, I'll be ready to try out. I feel discouraged about trying out this year, knowing I’m not quite there yet. My family's encouragement helps, but I don't want to embarrass myself. I can already envision myself on the field in a UT uniform. It would be incredible. That's my dream! If I can be among the best players in my city, why shouldn't I have a chance on the team? I just feel like I lack the necessary skills to play at the university level. It's fine for high school, but college sports are a different beast. I love being away from home for college, the freedom is amazing. No more curfews or having to check in. However, there are more responsibilities, and I'm learning to manage my time better. The upcoming Incubus concert is something I’m planning to attend since deciding yesterday. I've only heard a few of their songs, so I'm not a die-hard fan. But I'm open to the experience; it's my first real concert. I know I should save money, but why not indulge in something worthwhile? It's an experience worth having.\n",

      "I'm dealing with a lot of stress right now, and since I have to do this stream of consciousness exercise, I figured this would be a good place to let it all out. Being a freshman on a campus of 50,000 people is a bit overwhelming, but it's not as scary as everyone made it out to be, at least not yet. My main stressors are actually outside of college. Right now, my biggest issue is with my parents. They've been divorced for a while, but lately, they've started fighting and bickering over everything, and I always end up in the middle. My mom often complains about how hard her life is because of my dad, and while I know he's not perfect, the way she talks about him makes it seem like he's not even human. My dad is very critical of everything my mom does, and both of them feel the need to tell me their side of the story. I understand that after a bitter divorce, there will be problems, and they have every right to be angry with each other. But I just wish they wouldn't drag me into it. I've told them this multiple times, and they apologize and promise to stop, but before long, they're back to their old ways, and it makes me feel really small. I'm forced to choose sides, and since I love both of them, it's a really tough and stressful situation. I'm getting to the point where I might tell them both that I won't speak to either of them or have any contact until they can at least tolerate living in the same city. I don't expect them to love each other again or even like each other, but I just want things to be relatively peaceful and not a constant war zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue is the separation between me and my siblings. This isn't because I live on campus, my little sister lives with my mom, and my brother lives with my dad. While it's not the ideal situation, it's not terrible. The real problem is that their fighting has caused rifts between us. We end up taking sides against our parents and, by extension, against each other. I feel like I can't say anything negative about my mom in front of my sister because she'll just tell my mom. If I wanted to say those things to my mom, I would say them directly. I don't need a messenger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Pennebaker, if you're reading this, I accidentally hit send before I finished writing. I apologize and hope this doesn't cause any issues. Anyway, another problem I have is with my relationship with my mom. We've always had different personalities, and they often clash. We've had periods where we were furious with each other, but I feel like the current situation is the worst. She's gone through a lot of personal changes, mostly physical. She's changing her last name, dyeing her hair different colors, and considering a nose ring. On an intellectual level, I understand why she's doing this. If I were in her shoes, I would want to discover who I am, and I would feel hurt if my daughter didn't approve. However, these changes still upset me a lot, and she can't understand or accept why I feel this way. It took me a while to figure out why I have a problem with this. Talking to a friend helped me realize that the relationship with your mother is supposed to be one of the most meaningful and important in your life. A mother is supposed to be a steady force, always there for you and providing comfort and support. Even before she started changing, we had drifted apart, and I barely knew who she was. Now, after all the changes, I really don't know her. She doesn't seem to be a rock for my life. The hardest part is that she doesn't seem to care how I feel about her changes. I'm not the most emotionally open person, but I was so upset about her changing her name that I actually confronted her about it. This is so unlike me, and I felt very vulnerable. She seemed concerned and promised we would talk more before she did anything. But two days later, she changed her name anyway, without further discussion. I never asked her to change her life for me, but I wanted her to know how I felt and that her changes were upsetting me. I think this is a reasonable request. Her disregard for my feelings hurt me a lot, and we're on bad terms right now. I feel very alone, and I'm not sleeping well. My appetite has decreased, and I can't find joy in anything I do. The friends I had in high school have moved away, and the new friends I've made at UT always seem to have more important things to do. I'm not a top priority for anyone, and I often feel like if I were to just leave, no one would notice. If anyone is reading this, don't think this is a plea for help or that I'm considering anything drastic. I'm just having a rough time. I know Dr. Pennebaker suggests writing about your deepest thoughts and feelings to relieve stress. At this point, I agree that this exercise is very helpful and calms my nerves. I don't know what I'll write about for other stream of consciousness exercises, as I feel like I've covered everything important to me here. I hope that if anyone in my life reads this and is upset, they will understand that I have a special circumstance in Dr. Pennebaker's class, and I just want to be treated like all the other freshmen who have the opportunity to write without consequence. I truly appreciate this chance to vent and think. Thank you.\n",

      "Right now, I'm really struggling to come to terms with college life. Everything seems to be going wrong for me. My computer is constantly malfunctioning, and I'm having a hard time figuring out how to fix it. If I were back home, I wouldn't have to worry about that. I'm also struggling to connect with people here; I feel like I don't have any close friends, and there's always nothing to do except watch TV, which never has any good shows on. I miss my girlfriend a lot and wish I was back home. On top of everything else, I'm feeling unwell with a sore throat, and it feels like I'm stuck here with no end in sight. My living space is cramped and cluttered, and I'm not sure what to do about it. To be honest, I'm really frustrated with college right now and I don't see why people enjoy it so much. I'm starting to think I made a huge mistake by coming here, as nothing is going my way. I even have to wait for a set time to eat or walk a long distance, which is really inconvenient. I'm exhausted, but I know I should be studying – however, I'm not feeling motivated to do so. It feels like I'm constantly being let down. I'm so fed up with my new computer, which I paid a lot for, that I want to throw it out the window. I'm questioning whether I'm even in the right place; I don't know how I got accepted here in the first place. My memory is terrible, which you'd think would be a help, but it's not. I'm hungry, but it's like there's no place to get food. I feel like I'm on the verge of tears all the time due to all these reasons. I just wish I could feel happy like everyone else seems to.

      "I'm still trying to wrap my head around missing my first class this morning. I have no idea what happened - maybe my roommate accidentally turned off my alarm and forgot to tell me. But that doesn't seem likely since he's a great guy and wouldn't do something like that on purpose. Now I'm worried that I might have missed a quiz in kinesiology, which would be just my luck. It's already frustrating not having my books, and I'm falling behind in all my classes. The huge class sizes aren't helping either - it's overwhelming. And to make matters worse, I'm struggling to get back in shape. I've been running for three weeks, but I don't see much improvement, and if I want to make the cross-country team, I need to be faster than I was in high school. My old teammates aren't doing great either - they're about a minute and a half behind our times from last year. I used to run a 5K in 16:26, but now they're running 17:40. They've got a lot of ground to make up if they want to compete in our district, which is one of the toughest in the state. I'm still bitter about injuring myself during track season and having to take three months off - it killed my momentum, and I gained 20 pounds over the summer. But despite that, summer school was a blast. I met some cool people like Kevin, Rahim, and Justin, and a lot of girls. Although, it seemed like none of them were interested in me, and whenever someone did show interest, someone else would swoop in and steal the spotlight. I'm still a bit upset with Kevin for what he did with my best friend and the girl I care about deeply. It felt like my heart had been ripped out and put through a wringer. But I've talked to both Kevin and Heather, and we're good now. Speaking of which, Heather is coming to visit this weekend, and I'm super excited - I haven't seen her since before school started. I was disappointed that she didn't get into the architecture program at UT and had to go to ATM instead, but she's planning to transfer here in a year. I hope so, at least. I want to plan a fun weekend for us, but I have to work on Saturday and Sunday, so we'll have to make the most of Friday and my days off. My goal is to make her happy, even if it's not with me. I care about her deeply, and I think I might want to spend the rest of my life with her - she's my best friend, after all. I just don't want to risk messing up our perfect friendship, so we'll just have to see what happens.\n",

It's quiet here, just the sound of keys tapping, tap tap tap. I wish I could be in my room, blasting music, maybe some The Flaming Lips, especially their track Zaireeka. I bought it recently, but haven't had a chance to listen to it yet. It's a unique record, a four-disc concept album, all played at once. Wayne Coyne says it's about chaos and inspiration, and it makes sense, trust me. But when I tried to play it with friends, it was a mess. No one was really into it, and when it didn't go smoothly, they lost interest quickly. I still want to give it a shot, just need some passionate people to share it with.\n",

People are leaving, heading outside into the sunlight, while I'm stuck here, staring at my screen. I spent some time trying to figure out the prescreening stuff, registered, but couldn't find the survey link. I emailed Wendy or whoever, gotta remember to follow up later. Prescreening survey, do it before Sep 9, I think, for 1.5 hours credit. We're at the fifteen-minute mark, folks. That's the home stretch, sports lingo I don't understand. I hate football games, they bring out the rowdy crowd, and it's so crowded, I dread walking through it. Why did I choose a school with fifty thousand students? I'm spelling out numbers now, just typing away. No rush, that's why. Typing, typing, stream of consciousness, almost done. Nineteen minutes in, one minute to go. Come on, so close.

Tonight, Amy Alex and I are going to get pizza. Alex and I weren't getting along too well for a while. It was because I've been dating and spending less time with him. For a long time, it was just the two of us, neither one dating. Now that I'm dating, it bothered him a little. We talked about it, and he's better now. That's good, I don't like to fight with Alex. I have a lot to do this week. Tonight, I need to read and I would like to work on and, ideally, finish my calculus homework. Tomorrow, I'm going to apply for a job at the nature company in the mall. I talked to one of the managers at the forum last weekend, and he said they were hiring. That would be a good place to work, at least I like the store. We'll see. I guess I need to call my sister tonight. She always gets worked up if I don't talk to her once a week. I just talked to her the other day, though. Sometimes I just don't feel like talking to her. I hope someday she'll stop trying to mother me. I hope that now that she has a child, she'll let me be. I actually sort of enjoy my calculus class. This is my first time taking calculus, so I didn't know what to expect. It's pretty interesting. I'm really getting hungry, and it's going to be a couple of hours before I get to eat dinner. I wish my computer at home worked. It's so annoying that the computer people are being so stubborn about fixing it. I'm glad Uncle Mike is going to help me with it. Mom really did a good job when she picked Uncle Mike to be my financial adviser. I really care for him a lot. It's amazing to me that it's usually your friends that you can count on more than your family. You always expect to help your family, whether you like them or not, but your friends are chosen and they like you and want to help with things without holding it over your head. Unfortunately, most of the people in my family are big fans of the guilt trip. I can't stand that sort of thing.\"]\n",

The TV is a constant companion, but it's more of a distraction than a hindrance. My mind wanders to Abe Lincoln, a towering figure compared to my own stature. It's a pity I can't reach those heights. I could use a partner who's tall, you know. Just two minutes in, and I'm already frustrated. Give it a chance, I tell myself. I'm not great at this. I'm rambling. Let's focus. I adore apple sauce. As soon as I'm done, I'll indulge in a jar from my fridge. I'm not fond of people. Their behavior annoys me. I'm getting off track. Toys used to be the highlight of Christmas, but now it's a letdown. I hate Christmas. Spending time with family, the cheerful atmosphere, and the universal happiness... it's all too much. My roommate's antics are a constant irritation. He takes my things without asking. Sorry, he just walked in and reminded me he took my water bottle. I'm losing the thread. I dislike Christmas and my roommate equally. I feel like people have forgotten the real me. I'm sorry, I'm watching Rocky IV now. I love Rocky. He's inspiring. Even named my dog after him. Ten minutes in, and I'm still going strong. I'd be happier if everyone focused on church instead of Santa. I'm talking to myself again. DING! That's a line from Rocky IV. Favorite line, \"Age before beauty,\" as Apollo Creed speaks. My roommate took my boxers. Sorry, I just pressed enter as if I were sending a message. Spell 'messenger'? Oh, there you go. It's just he was shopping, and I found a pair I liked. We weren't alone; there were girls with us. For the record. I liked a pair and... I'm messing up the assignment. DING DING! The witch is dead. I'm tired and feel rather dense. Hi, my name is the undead, and I love sleeping. Lost in thought. Hmmmm, pizza rolls. My roommate made some, probably mine. He's a thief. I want to be an actor. I love the five Rocky movies. I wish I had an accent, like Scottish or German. The word 'Finish' looks German. I tried learning German, FOR THAT BITCH!!! I hate everything. Especially her. Not really, I actually love her. I'm just... grr. I hate that time of my life. I wish I were six feet tall. That would be awesome. Hot, a funny word. Sorry, I just heard it on TV. Lacrosse is fun. I hope to play someday. My roommate's constant interruptions are a pain. NO, he's cool. It's just I... I need to stay on track. School educates me, and I enjoy it. Drugs are terrible. I need to eat healthier.

It seems like that helped me a bit, as I'm not as down or sorrowful as before. I ran into Mo and Ricky this morning. I think Mo might think I've become strange or edgy, or he might even think I'm crazy and there's something wrong with me. Yeah, there's definitely something wrong with me. I really wanted to talk to him and I miss him a lot when we don't spend time together. I used to try harder to see him and hang out with him, but now it hurts to be around him. He's one of my closest friends and I care deeply for him. I want the best for him and I feel like he doesn't deserve someone like me. I'm so lost and depressed. It's hard to talk to people about it, but I know I need to. Connie doesn't really get it, or maybe she doesn't want to. I tried so hard to connect with her, but she seems either insensitive or she's being purposely cold. I don't think she realizes what she's doing to me. Please, God, help me get through this. I truly believe that only You can help me and guide me out of this misery. I miss feeling Your love. I feel so alone and it's hard to talk to my mom about this. She has high expectations for me and it hurts her to see me like this, but I don't know what to do. I don't feel capable of doing anything well, or even want to do anything. I thought mom was okay with me getting an elementary education, but she said no. What can I do? I really want to be the daughter my parents want me to be. I want to be the friend my other friends want me to be. I want to be the sister Sungmin and Sungchan want me to be. Most of all, I want to be someone that I want to be and that will make everyone, especially You, happy. I'm so confused. Lord, I don't know what to do and it makes me sad, depressed, and unhappy. I don't have any motivation to do anything and it's hard because school has already started. When I feel like crying or feeling down, I want to talk to Timmy, Steve, Mo, Betty, Connie, mom, etc. but I can't talk to Timmy for some reason. Instead, I end up being mean to him. I hope he knows it's not intentional. I wonder if he still likes me, but I don't think so anymore. Guys can be so unpredictable. Steve, I want to talk to him, but I can't rely on him too much because he's getting married soon and I shouldn't be around him that much. Mo, I want to talk to him, but he's one of my problems. Why can't you just be a friend to me? Betty and Connie, I shouldn't talk to them so much, actually, I kind of regret sharing so much with them. But they're my friends and I hope they don't betray my trust. Writing about all these things that have been bothering me for so long makes me feel better. I guess my 20 minutes are up. Maybe things will be better today.]\n",

      "As I sit here trying to figure out what to write, I find that my thoughts are flowing, but my motivation isn't quite there. Writing is usually one of my easy tasks, but this assignment has me stumped. I'm not sure what's making it harder - maybe I'm just really tired from a long day, or the fact that I'm running low on energy. I'm looking forward to tomorrow, though - Thursday is usually my easiest day because I don't have to wake up at the usual 9 am. It's also just one step closer to the weekend, which I've grown to love. And, to be honest, I still prefer 9 am to 8 am - back in high school, that's when I first started school. Compared to that, college seems like a breeze, but it's also a lot more challenging. One of the hardest things is leaving behind the people and life you knew in high school. Not to mention, growing up is still a work in progress. I'm happy to say that I've made a pretty smooth transition so far, but there are still some tough times ahead. One of my biggest struggles is the amount of reading required - while I used to enjoy reading, it's not my favorite pastime anymore. Another challenge I'm facing is that it's up to me to make the choice to read or not read. This realization has hit me hard because I'm finally out in the real world, where everything is based on my choices. I find it both scary and exhilarating at the same time - it's a lot of pressure, but it's also an incredible opportunity to shape my future however I want.\n",

The color white doesn't seem to fit me. I think it's because I'm outgoing, and white is boring. The air conditioner in my apartment keeps me distracted; it's like it's always interrupting my thoughts. Blue pops into my head, but I can't see air, so it's weird that I'd associate it with blue. I keep thinking about a Puff Daddy song, and I keep repeating the verse, wondering if it's his. He's been accused of copying songs, but I don't know. I'm writing a lot, and it's not because I'm complaining. Usually, I don't think about anything. I think I need to pay more attention to myself, to what my mind is telling me. If I could just listen to my thoughts more, maybe I'd be a better person. I wonder if my girlfriend is doing anything right now. It's weird how much I care about what others are thinking, but I don't care as much about what I'm thinking. I wonder what all these thoughts mean. I wonder if there's a test that could tell me how I think, but that seems silly. The weather isn't supposed to affect how I feel, but the sound of rain makes me want to sleep. I wonder where my parents are, if they're at work or home. It's raining here, but I don't know if it's raining where they are. I wonder why people say an eclipse is bad for pregnant women.

      "Today was a really humid day while I was out on campus, but now that I'm back home, I see so many people coming in from campus, getting off the bus with water bottles. I've realized that Texas weather can be quite unpredictable. One moment it's humid, and the next, it's scorching. It's clear now, and I'm sure it's not that hot because it's going to be around 60 degrees soon, and it usually cools down around this time. Earlier, I thought it might rain, but I really don't like walking in the rain. My first day at UT, it rained, and I got lost, feeling miserable. By the time you get home, you often get soaked, and the air conditioning units are on all over campus, making you feel chilly during your classes. Sometimes, I wonder how UT students feel away from home. I was extremely homesick during my first semester, even though I was only 30 minutes away. I lived in an apartment during my first year and regret not living in a dorm, as I could have met more people. On the other hand, I liked having my own space and not sharing a bathroom. During my first year, I didn't meet many people, but by my second year, I was introduced to many more, and I started enjoying college rather than just staying at home, reading, or doing homework and watching TV. There's been a big change from then to now. Now, I actually prefer staying in Austin on weekends instead of going home because I always have something to do. At home, I get bored easily. Of course, I still miss my parents, but it's so different here with all my friends. There's always something going on. College life is super busy. This semester feels like it's going to fly by. Before I know it, I'll be on Thanksgiving break, then studying for finals, and then home again in two weeks. Sometimes, I feel like I need to be more active in school programs and associations, but I never have time. Something is always coming up, or most of the time, I'm just too tired to do anything. For instance, right now, I wish I was lying in bed taking a nap because I'll probably have to hit the books as soon as I finish this writing assignment. Twenty minutes can feel like a very long time. As you can probably tell, I'm getting very restless. I have very short patience and like to take care of my business and move on to the next thing. Time can be very crucial sometimes. When I'm late to class, I wish I had more time to take care of everything before I leave, but other times, when I have too much time, I wish I had some chores to do or homework, which can be a killer sometimes. I don't like how this apartment is never the right temperature; it's always too cold or too hot. It's never the right temperature because all the rooms in the apartment are at different angles, so they get cold and hot at different rates. My roommates and I always change the temperature on the thermostat according to our preferences. Oh well, I guess that's how it works. I just checked the timer, and I have a minute or so left, so now I'm thinking about time and going totally blank on my other thoughts. It's nice to randomly talk about different stuff.

      "I'm shocked that I skipped my first class this morning. I'm not sure what happened. Perhaps my roommate accidentally turned off my alarm early without letting me know. However, I'm pretty sure he wouldn't do that because he's a decent guy. I really hope there wasn't a quiz in kinesiology today. That would be just terrible timing. It's not surprising that I'm falling behind in all my classes without my books. Catching up is going to be a real challenge. There are so many people in each of my classes, it's overwhelming. And it's ridiculous that I don't have my books. I'm struggling to get in shape and it's taking me longer than I expected. I've been running for three weeks now and I'm not seeing much progress. If I want to join the cross country team here, I need to be faster than I was in high school. My old high school teammates are struggling too. They're lagging about a minute and a half behind last year's top runners. I used to run a 16:26 for a 5K, but these guys are running around 17:40 for a 5K. They have a lot of ground to make up if they want to compete in one of the toughest districts. I really dislike the woodlands, cedar park, and Georgetown districts. I regret injuring myself during track season because I had to take three months off and it's tough without running. I gained about 20 pounds during the summer session at UT. But, I did enjoy meeting new people like Kevin, Rahim, and Justin. I also met quite a few girls, though none of them seemed to find me attractive. Whenever a girl approaches me at a party, someone like Kevin or Rahim usually takes her. I'm still upset about what Kevin did. It felt like he took my heart and crushed it. But I had a talk with both Heather and Kevin, and things seem to be okay now. I'm excited because Heather is coming to visit this weekend, even though she couldn't come to UT due to her not getting into artiture school. I'm planning a fun weekend with activities for us to enjoy, so we can reconnect. I just want her to be happy, whether it's with me or not. I'm committed to her, as I love her deeply and consider her my best friend. I hope she feels the same way. I'm uncertain about what will happen, but I'm willing to see how things unfold.\n",

( sound of pages being flipped through ) Nope, no, no one but Stanley and me. Just how did you get in here.

Stepping into their manager's office, Stanley and Mariella were once again stunned to discover not an indication of any human life. Aside from each other of course, which was entirely beside the point. What they could not have known was that the keypad behind the boss's desk guarded the terrible truth that their boss had been keeping from them, and so he had assigned it an extra secret pin number: 2-8-4-5. Yet incredibly, by simply pushing random buttons on the keypad, Stanley and Mariella happened to input the correct code by sheer luck. Amazing. They stepped into the newly opened passageway. \n",
      " \n",
      " Stanley and Mariella entered the elevator that they found there. As they descended deeper into the building, they wondered what dark secrets they would find there. They were comforted that they would not be facing the horrors they found there alone. This companionship, this partnership, would allow them to confront whatever they found there. At the bottom they found a door that read `` Mind Control Facility''. But look! To the side a sign that says Escape. Oh, that sounds like a much better option. Who knows what you could find in a Mind Control Facility, better not find out. Escape is what you want anyways, right? Freedom, wide-open skies, birds, rainbows, puppies. That seems just wonderful. \n",
      " \n",
      " Stanley and Mariella followed the tunnel. They were confident that sign had been correct and not at all an obvious trap. This passage would lead to their freedom, it must lead to their freedom. Anyways, it had to lead somewhere, and anywwhere was better than where they were. So they continued forward. At the end of the tunnel they found a hole. Mariella jumped into the hole first. Oh, go on. It's perfectly safe. Do n't worry about the fact that it's a dark, narrow hole whose bottom you ca n't see. I would tell you if it was n't safe. I'm looking out for what's best for you. Mariella jumped into the hole first. \n",
      " \n",
      " Sorry, Stanley. I did n't want to do this, but she was ruining the story, your story. It is the Stanley Parable after all. When I said I wanted what was best for you I was being perfectly honest, I want what is best for you. Not her. I gave her plenty of opportunity to leave but she just would n't do it. Now we can enjoy our story. Here, I'll restart the game so that you do n't even remember that she was here at all. What do you say?\n",

In a bold move, Palahniuk decided to address this directly, opting to come out publicly to avoid the risk of being exposed. This revelation, shared through an audio blog, marked a significant turning point for Palahniuk, who felt compelled to speak up after the publication of the article. \"I've been keeping it a secret for 11 years,\" Palahniuk boldly stated, shattering the silence surrounding his personal life. His decision to come out not only revealed his sexual orientation but also underscored the importance of open communication and the courage to live authentically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Palahniuk's choice to share his truth was met with a wave of support from his followers, who rallied around him, echoing the sentiment that \"death threats are not supportive.\" This outpouring of encouragement highlights the profound impact that coming out can have, not only on the individual but also on their community.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the world of print media, where privacy and discretion are often prioritized, Palahniuk's decision to reveal his personal life was a radical move. His actions served as a reminder that sometimes, the only way to ensure acceptance and understanding is by being open about who we are.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aftermath of this bold declaration has been both liberating and challenging. On one hand, Palahniuk's courage has opened the door for greater conversations about LGBTQ+ rights and acceptance. On the other hand, it has also brought forth a wave of reactions, from genuine support to concern and even fear, particularly among those who might feel vulnerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, Palahniuk's decision to come out not only reflects his personal journey but also serves as a powerful narrative for many. It underscores the importance of living authentically and the courage it takes to do so, especially in a world that often demands secrecy and silence. As Palahniuk himself wisely puts it, \"Just come out already and stop dancing around the subject.\" His words resonate with anyone who has ever felt the pressure to keep their personal truths hidden, urging them to embrace their truth and live with authenticity.\n",

We focused on a few techniques, notably katate dori gyaku hamni nikyo, which, while challenging, provided a great workout for my right wrist. Thankfully, after the practice, my wrist felt fine, indicating that the initial discomfort was merely temporary. It was a pleasure to welcome two new white belts to our dojo. They were friendly and engaging, though I'm still unsure about their ages and professions. They maintained a lively conversation amongst themselves, yet they were pleasant to train with. I observed that they were open-minded, which made them receptive to all the teachings during the class.\n",

      "Looking ahead, I'm excited to join the combined training at Tanglin Community Club tomorrow, alongside Ueshiba Aikido. Sensei mentioned that we've been accustomed to ample space during our training, which has led to a certain level of luxury. However, the upcoming experience in a more confined and crowded environment will be beneficial. It will enhance our awareness during ukemi (falling techniques) and improve our control over our movements, ensuring we don't inadvertently land on top of our training partners. This new challenge will undoubtedly push us to refine our techniques and deepen our understanding of Aikido's principles.\n",

Moving forward, I'm looking to put the negativity behind me and focus on something more positive. Yesterday, I had the luxury of sleeping in, which was incredibly rejuvenating. After catching up on my daily dose of internet browsing (news, email, etc.), I dove back into my current Java book, which I'm finding to be really engaging. I'm learning the basics of internet connections through Java, and I have to say, it's been easier than I expected.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ah, Monday, the day starts with the usual hustle and bustle at the store, but today, it was a day I won't soon forget. The temperature was a mere high 20's outside, yet inside, the battle against the elements and the customer's odor raged on. As an employee, I'm used to the chilly climate, but the irony was not lost on me when a customer, clad in a winter jacket and snowpants, walked in, turning the already stuffy air inside our store even warmer. \n",
      "\n",
      "The air conditioner was on, and we were all feeling the heat, but it was nothing compared to the stench that hit us as soon as this particular customer entered. The smell was so overpowering, it was like inhaling a mix of horse manure, hay, and bad breath. I found myself turning my head, desperately trying to gulp in some fresh air. It was as if the scent was seeping through the fabric of his attire, clinging stubbornly to every corner of the store. It was nothing short of a sensory assault, and I could feel the discomfort radiating off the customers who were also present.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the real challenge came from his incessant inquiries. This man seemed to have an insatiable curiosity for the smallest details, asking me questions like, \"Do you have any pens that fit this refill?\" It was as if he was buying the ink filter as his primary concern, and then moving on to a pen. I couldn't help but shake my head at his peculiar shopping behavior. It felt like he was on a mission to test our patience, and honestly, we were all feeling the strain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had already explained that we didn't carry refills and that the customer should just buy a pen, but it seemed his mind was made of stone. He kept asking about the ink's composition, as if the ingredients would make a difference in his pen-buying experience. It was as if he was searching for a hidden treasure, but all I could offer was a simple writing instrument.\n",
      "\n",
      "After almost 20 minutes of this relentless questioning, he left our store empty-handed. As he promised to return, I couldn't help but feel a mix of frustration and sympathy. He had certainly tested our patience, but perhaps I had been too harsh. Maybe he was just a quirky individual, lost in his own world of peculiarities.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I took a moment to collect my thoughts, I couldn't help but reflect on the day's events. It was a day filled with unexpected challenges - from battling the smell to dealing with a customer whose priorities seemed to be as skewed as the weather outside. It reminded me that every day can bring a new set of situations, and it's our job to navigate through them with patience and a sense of humor.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, fellow employees, how was your Monday? Have you encountered any peculiar customers or unusual situations that left you scratching your head in confusion? Let's share our stories and find solace in the fact that we're all in this together, facing the daily grind with resilience and a touch of humor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the next time you find yourself in a similar situation, maybe spare a thought for the store employees who are trying to keep the peace while enduring the smell of horse manure and the constant barrage of bizarre questions. And, perhaps, remember to shower before entering the store, just in case.\n",

      "Will's mother, whom we'll call Franny, has been a significant figure in his life for years. She championed his creative work, securing a book deal for him and hiring him for brainstorming projects. In a way, she treated Will like a pet project. While I thought it was sweet, it also annoyed me. Franny and Will's parents viewed him as the Golden Boy, while they dismissed my own talents and contributions, even though I am just as capable.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Will and I had been living together for about two years, Franny called and proposed that she would pay for Will to travel to Los Angeles. At the time, Will aspired to be a screenwriter. Franny, it seemed, wanted to get Will to move 3000 miles away from me at all costs. I don't believe I'm misinterpreting her intentions. Despite my urging, Will went to LA, and when he returned, he was distant and weird. I was also distant and did some things I'm not proud of. When Will announced his intention to move to LA, he made no effort to include me in the plan. We were broke, and me going with him was not an option. He didn't ask for my opinion. I got drunk and did something very hurtful. I believe Franny had poisoned his mind against me.\n",

      "Will moved to LA, and things worked out well for him. He became a creative executive rather than a screenwriter. We worked through our issues and I moved to LA in April of the previous year. A few weeks after I arrived, Franny called and said she was in LA for a few days and could she buy us lunch? We said yes, and the food was very good. \n",
      "\n",
      "A few months later, Will told me that Franny had written a letter shortly after our lunch, titled 'Why Annika Is Not For Will.' She thought I was beneath him and believed I would drive a wedge between him and his parents. We never saw the letter, but I'm certain it was revolting. Will was furious and ripped it up. We haven't heard from Franny since. She's off the guest list for our wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday, my Grandpa died. Will came home at lunchtime, and we were cuddling on the couch when the phone rang. I expected it to be my father, but it was Franny. She called to ask if I would be interested in cutting the hair of a Nativity scene that had arrived in less-than-perfect condition in LA. The figurines had straw hair that wasn't trimmed, and the vendor was displeased. Franny wanted me to pick up the merchandise, bring it home, and cut the hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "I explained that my grandfather had just died and I didn't know when the funeral was. Franny asked if I could check with Will and see if we could think of anyone else who might do it. She got excited about the idea of seeing me in Pittsburgh. I managed not to reply with the harsh truth. The whole conversation left me confused, and I didn't believe it was real until Will's mom called to offer her condolences. She even offered to help if I needed anything during the funeral.\n",
      "\n",
      "I finally hung up, relayed the entire conversation to Will, and collapsed on the couch, alternately laughing and crying. I explained the situation to a friend who might have done it for the money, and he laughed even more. I took a nap because my head hurt, and I didn't wake up until Will came home. I didn't know what to do about calling Franny back, so I avoided it. This morning, I drove Will to work and begged him to deal with it. He called his mom instead.\n",

The incident occurred Friday night as a group of Manhattan College students were walking home from a nearby diner, police said.  The man, identified as 32-year-old Luis Rodriguez, approached the group and demanded their valuables, brandishing a knife, police said.  But the students, who had taken self-defense classes as part of their school's security program, quickly sprang into action. They formed a circle around Rodriguez, keeping a safe distance while one student called 911. Another student, a former high school wrestling champion, managed to disarm Rodriguez and hold him in a chokehold until police arrived.  'We were scared, but we knew we had to stay calm and work together,' said one of the students, who wished to remain anonymous.  Rodriguez was later charged with robbery, criminal possession of a weapon and menacing. The students were praised by their school and local police for their quick thinking and bravery.\"\n",

      "In a recent statement, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif announced that Iran has concluded its retaliatory attacks following the US targeted killing of top military commander Qassim Suleimani. The move comes after a series of escalating tensions between Iran and the United States, which culminated in Iranian missile strikes on US military bases in Iraq. The crisis has sparked concerns over regional stability, with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warning of further action if necessary. The attacks have also had significant implications for global oil markets and cultural heritage sites in the region. As diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation continue, Zarif's statement suggests a potential shift towards diplomacy, although the US-Iran relationship remains precarious under the Trump administration.

      "Introduction:\n",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant changes in daily life, including increased stress, anxiety, and feelings of hostility. As people adapt to new norms and restrictions, maintaining mental health has become a priority. One effective strategy to improve mental well-being is regular exercise.

      "\n",
      "Methodology:\n",
      "The study involved 1,000 participants aged 18 to 65, who were divided into two groups. The control group maintained their usual level of physical activity, while the intervention group was instructed to engage in moderate-intensity exercise for four days a week. The exercise regimen included activities such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming. Participants were assessed for mood, anxiety, and hostility levels before and after the 12-week intervention period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results:\n",
      "The results showed a significant improvement in mood, anxiety, and hostility levels among the intervention group compared to the control group.

      "\n",
      "Discussion:\n",
      "The findings of this study align with previous research on the positive effects of exercise on mental health. Regular physical activity has been shown to increase the production of endorphins, which are natural mood elevators. Additionally, exercise can help reduce stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, contributing to a more balanced mental state. The study also emphasizes the importance of consistency in exercise routines, as the benefits are cumulative and require regular engagement.\n",

      "In recent years, the integration of deep learning techniques in medical image analysis has revolutionized the field, particularly in the domain of image segmentation. This study presents an innovative approach to interactive medical image segmentation using deep learning with image-specific fine-tuning. The proposed method leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is further enhanced by incorporating a user-interactive module that allows clinicians to provide feedback during the segmentation process. This feedback mechanism enables the model to learn from the clinician's expertise, resulting in improved segmentation accuracy. The image-specific fine-tuning process involves adjusting the pre-trained model parameters based on the unique characteristics of each medical image, ensuring that the model is well-adapted to the specific imaging modality and patient cohort. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed interactive medical image segmentation approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving superior performance in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness. This advancement holds great promise for facilitating more precise and efficient diagnosis and treatment planning in clinical practice.\n",

The colony was named after the Delaware River, which was named after the Delaware Indians, a Native American tribe that lived in the area.\n",

      "The Delaware Colony was established by English settlers who were primarily Quakers, led by William Penn, who later became its proprietor. The colony was initially known as the Colony of New Castle, but it was renamed to the Delaware Colony in 1682. The colony was located in the eastern part of the present-day state of Delaware and extended into parts of what are now Pennsylvania and Maryland.\n",

      "In the heart of ancient Egypt, where the golden sands whispered secrets of the past, there existed a deity so feared, his name was spoken only in hushed tones - The Scorpion God. This mythological figure, with the body of a man and the tail of a scorpion, was said to possess the power to control the very fabric of life and death. His domain was the underworld, where souls of the deceased would journey to be judged, and it was believed that The Scorpion God held the keys to the afterlife.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story of The Scorpion God begins with the creation myth of Egypt, where he was said to have emerged from the primordial waters of chaos, his scorpion tail glowing with an otherworldly energy. As the people of Egypt began to worship him, they believed that his power could be harnessed for protection and strength. Warriors would adorn their armor with the symbol of The Scorpion God, believing it would grant them invincibility in battle.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, as time passed, the worship of The Scorpion God took a darker turn. His followers began to practice dark magic, seeking to unleash his power for their own gain. The once great deity was now feared and reviled, his name becoming synonymous with evil and destruction. The people of Egypt began to turn away from his worship, seeking solace in the more benevolent gods of their pantheon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite this, the legend of The Scorpion God lived on, passed down through generations in hushed whispers and forbidden texts. It was said that on certain nights, when the stars aligned in the shape of a scorpion, The Scorpion God would rise from the underworld, his tail glowing with an eerie light, seeking out those who would unleash his power once more upon the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "In modern times, the legend of The Scorpion God has inspired countless works of fiction, from novels to films, each attempting to capture the essence of this mysterious and feared deity. Yet, the true power of The Scorpion God remains a mystery, hidden deep within the sands of time, waiting for one brave enough to uncover it. Will you dare to unleash the power of The Scorpion God, or will you heed the warnings of the past and leave this ancient deity to rest in the depths of the underworld? The choice is yours, but be warned: the power of The Scorpion God comes at a steep price, one that may cost you your very soul.\n",

      "\n",
      "Abstract:\n",
      "\n",
      "Iris recognition has emerged as a vital biometric authentication technique, offering a non-invasive and secure method for individual identification. Recent advancements in smartphone technology have enabled the development of high-quality cameras capable of capturing detailed iris images. This study proposes a novel approach to iris recognition using a database of iris images obtained through a smartphone camera. The proposed system leverages the unique characteristics of the iris, such as the unique patterns and colors, to create a robust and accurate identification system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed system consists of two primary stages: image acquisition and feature extraction. The image acquisition stage utilizes the smartphone camera to capture high-quality iris images in visible light. The feature extraction stage employs a deep learning-based approach to extract relevant features from the captured images, including texture, color, and shape. These features are then used to train a machine learning model for iris recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed system has been evaluated using a dataset of iris images obtained from a diverse group of individuals. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, achieving an accuracy of 95.6% in distinguishing between different individuals. The system's performance is further enhanced by incorporating a machine learning-based approach to adapt to variations in lighting conditions and pose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed system has significant implications for various applications, including border control, law enforcement, and healthcare. The use of smartphone cameras to capture iris images eliminates the need for specialized equipment, making it a cost-effective and accessible solution for large-scale iris recognition systems. The proposed system's ability to adapt to different lighting conditions and pose variations also makes it suitable for real-world applications.\n",

Now, I see that I could have had a fulfilling career doing something I love, and I can't help but feel a sense of regret.\n",

      "\"I hardly ever sit down to write without knowing exactly where my thoughts are heading. I'm currently longing for some tranquility. I've always lived in a serene house, and I suppose I've just taken its calmness for granted. Despite the rare disagreements between my studies and my room's party, I'm content with my life. I'm heading home this weekend, and though I've only been in Austin for two weeks, it already feels like home. My house is just like a place I visit sometimes. I'm not sure if it's good or bad that this change in my life doesn't upset me, but whatever the case, that's what I'm going to do. I'm currently stuck, struggling to come up with a topic. It would take too long to explain what's on my mind, and I don't usually share personal stories. For now, I'll write about my best friend. She's attending A&M, and I'll see her in about a week for her sister's wedding. It's odd to think about her without her. We used to talk every day in high school, and four years is a long time. However, I don't think our friendship has suffered due to the distance. I believe that once you understand what makes someone unique, that relationship remains constant. Because the core of a person never changes. The facades people put on may alter, but the essence remains the same. I'm excited about the wedding because it feels like I haven't seen her in a while.\n",

      "O.K., time for another random topic. Dating in college. I'm actually looking forward to it. There are around 25,000 new girls in this city, and some of them are bound to be interesting. However, it's a bit odd to think about dating since it's been only a month since I ended my high school relationship. Whew, it's so hot in here. Well, my ex-girlfriend. I'm not sure where this subject will lead, as I find it hard to talk about the past. I believe everyone alters their memories, either with rose-tinted glasses or blinders. I'd rather focus on the present. Memories can be enjoyable, but as with anything else, you can overdo it. Right now, the most important thing in my mind is to maintain good grades and not lose my social life or sanity in the process. I don't think it'll be too difficult. When you're passionate about what you study, it's not work. Instead of draining your energy, it gives you more energy. New things to learn, new goals to strive for. I love it. I've been writing for quite a while now, but I can't tell how long it's been. A mental note to self: pick up a new Pat Green CD for dad tomorrow and give Angela a call. Well, this is my train of thought. It's not a deep stream, but it's mine. To wrap up, I'll remind myself of some wise words once said by a wise man: Never play poker with a man named Doc, never eat at a place called Mom's, never date a woman with a dagger tattoo on her, never try to teach a pig to sing, and finally, the ultimate truth in the universe: frogs will always butt their heads whenever they jump. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Don't forget to tip your waitress. Good Night!\"\n",

      "'Well, here I go with the good old stream of consciousness assignment again. I feel like I'm back in freshman HS English class again. Not that that's a bad thing, mind you, but my English teacher freshman year made us do these assignments constantly, and mine were always completely ridiculous, like, \"wow, I'm really hungry. I wish I could go to Taco Bell.\" They really had no point, except as busy work. In a psychology class, though, I can see the reasoning behind an assignment like this. Just letting my mind go free, and putting my random thoughts down in writing could be a big help in figuring out why I'm such a psychological screw-up. Well, that's not true. I don't want y'all getting the wrong idea about me, being that today was the first day of class and all. I'm really not a nut case. People may think I am, but really, I'm a normal kind of gal. Actually, down here in Texas, I guess I'm not normal. I don't like to eat biscuits and gravy for breakfast, and country fried steak with fried okra for dinner. I'm from Connecticut, and we don't even HAVE okra, much less worship it like it's some kind of vegetable goddess. My mind is starting to go blank--performance pressure I guess. I'm on the spot here--I don't want you all to be bored while you're reading this, if you ever do get around to reading this, that is. Well, I'm not going to stress just yet, so you're probably going to have to listen to some of my random, incoherent babbling for a few paragraphs. These computers are a big old pain in the ass. Here in the SMF, sure, they've got a bajillion computers, but unfortunately, we've got 42 bajillion students trying to use them, all at the same time. I think I'll be spending quite a few late, late nights in the computer center, just to get my stuff done. Yippee. That's what college is all about--late nights in the libraries. Yeah. Right. At this point, I don't even know what college is all about. I probably shouldn't say anything though, seeing as how I'm going to have to write another one of these thingys in a few days, where the topic is \"college\" Blah, blah, blah. I can't believe I'm actually doing this assignment on the same day that is was assigned! Go me! Talk about dedication. I really can't believe this. In high school, procrastination was my middle name. No, it was my first name. By second semester, I have more free periods in a day than actual classes, so I didn't have to do a damn thing. It was great! Unfortunately, because of that, I'm going to have to work that much harder here at UT, to get those studying skills back up to par. High School. Now that was a trip. When I was there, I couldn't wait to get out of there. I hated that school, that town, everything except my friends, of course. Then, my family moved, right after graduation, and I learned real quick that there were worse places to be than in my old town. At least back home I have my friends and my boyfriend and my piece of crap car, and I knew what there was to do. After I moved, I had no friends, no life, no car, no nothing. I worked all day. That's it. Now, though, I'm ready for this whole college thing. Austin seems like a fun city, where I might actually enjoy spending the next four years. Oh yeah. While we're on the subject of \"four years,\" why is it that all the professors & administrators that give speeches and stuff always make it sound like we'll be in college for like, 5 or 6 years? I'm sorry, but I plan on graduating in 4 years. What's the problem here? What are people doing, that they can't graduate in 4 years? I just don't get it. No offense if any of y'all reading this took like 7 years to do your undergrad work. I'm not trying to knock you, just trying to figure this out. Well, it's 9:19, exactly 18 minutes after I started this nifty little piece of writing that makes no sense and has no point. I'm not really sure if I have fulfilled this assignment, like if I was supposed to analyze my personal stream of consciousness, where it took me, and what that means regarding my own personality. I guess if I had to, I could say that my mind works in mysterious ways, and even if the above essay seems to be illogically connected, to me, I can see the patterns. Yeah. I just went back & tried to read this over again, and I've got to give a suggestion. For these assignments, make the box we're writing in a box where you can see the whole line of writing at one time, without have to scroll across , because it's a real big pain for me, and I'm sure it's just as big a pain for you when you're trying to read it. Unless, of course, when you read it, you can see the whole line at once. I don't know, just a suggestion! Thanks for taking the time to give us all the opportunity to get an easy 10 % of out final grade through these writing assignments!'\n",

Before the big change, college, I was always stressing out. Worrying was my go-to. But now, I've learned to see things differently. I still get anxious, but I've realized that every moment doesn't have to be about schoolwork. Just hanging out with friends or taking a breather can be just as enriching as hitting the books. Like last night, I watched a movie, something I hardly do because I feel like I'm not being productive. But this movie really got me thinking about the world.

My weekend is going to be all about studying for those two tests. I hope I can focus on them and nothing else. Austin, or rather UT, is a great campus for getting around. Unlike my hometown, I can walk or take the bus to many places here. That's pretty tempting! I just got a laptop, which I'm super excited about. I felt rushed when I bought it, but it's too late now. I still need to get a PC card so I can use the internet in my dorm. I want to spend a weekend upgrading and buying software for my computer, but I've got so many things on my mind.

The game was exciting, despite the lopsided score. The next day, I spent some quality time with my youngest nephew, who's now learning to talk. I wish I could stay longer, but I'm grateful for the chance to see him grow up, even from a distance.\n",

She chose the film, as I insisted on being a gentleman, and we ended up watching 'Wicker Park'. It's a story about a man who spots a woman he once loved, chases after her, but gets entangled with a stalker-like woman who's infatuated with him. In the end, he finally connects with the woman he truly loves. I'm looking forward to winter, as my family and I have a tradition of going skiing in the Pacific Northwest. Last year, I had a nasty fall that left me with a concussion, but I'm eager to hit the slopes again.\n",

      "I'm just curious about how things will unfold, especially concerning my relationship since she's in California and I'm in Texas. Honestly, it shouldn't matter too much, considering my focus should be on school. It's unsettling here; no one I can really chat with, and it feels like everyone is struggling. Oh, I'm missing my little one. Am I making the right decisions in my classes? Am I also making the right choices in my relationship? If anything doesn't work out, what's next? My relationship is... confusing. This place is massive, and this university is massive. How am I going to stand out? I've barely met anyone, and my roommate's not much of a friend. I'm broke, and I'm unsure how to make up for the lack of funds. How am I to secure enough money for my tuition? My parents can't cover everything, and financial aid won't make up the rest. How am I to manage a job alongside school? Constantly thinking about my girlfriend, it feels like it's all her fault. This is hopeless. I'm not even sure if I'm doing this relationship thing correctly. My head hurts, and I hope I'm doing this assignment right. If not, I'm in trouble. Starting college is tough, and I've got a headache. I'm wondering if I'm even close to dying. It's been only 14 minutes, and I'm writing a lot of stuff. This feels like a stream of consciousness, isn't it? I'm trying to talk to myself, but no one's around. I don't recognize anyone here. I hope things improve. I'm not seeing much sense in this. I want a break and go home for a while. My parents' food is getting old, and I miss them. I just miss the lack of things to do. Maybe I'm just too lazy, I don't know. I'm not lazy; I need to think positively. I'm talking to myself again. What's the professor's thought on this paper? Out of hundreds of students, I doubt anyone will read it. I'm insignificant, really. Why so down on myself? \n",

      "So, what happened to the old version of you? Things change, right? They're never going to be the same. Didn't you say you wanted to go to college to escape everything?

      "I often find myself lost in deep thoughts, pondering over the happenings of the present moment and planning for the future. There's a sense of satisfaction that comes with being organized and having a well-structured schedule, but I sometimes wonder whether this tendency to overthink and overplan is simply a manifestation of good discipline or a cause for concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider, for instance, the first day of class when everyone is settling in and taking notes, I am already halfway through the first writing assignment. The task is done by my mind's own accord, without a second thought. But in this moment of focused productivity, my thoughts sometimes slip into the realm of the personal. I might start thinking about my girlfriend back at home and what she may be doing or contemplating. It is natural to wonder if she is thinking about me, and if so, I can't help but feel a wave of warmth and reassurance wash over me.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, these moments of reflection extend beyond just our personal relationships. I might think about my friends who went to other schools and how they are dealing with their own lives, their own challenges. Do they feel the same pressure to always be on top of things as I do? Are they experiencing similar doubts and anxieties, or are they living their lives with more ease and flexibility than I can muster?\n",
      "\n",

      "In moments like these, I can't help but seek guidance. Are there any topics that you, as an instructor, would like us to think about? Any particular themes or ideas that could benefit our studies and help us better understand the world around us? I often feel as though my mind is a whirlpool of thoughts, a constant stream of ideas that never seem to subside.\n",

      "Finally, as I navigate through the challenges and triumphs of the academic world, I can't help but wonder about my performance in this class. Will I thrive and be rewarded with an A, or will I struggle and receive a lower grade? Is it even worth wondering? In the end, I guess I'll just have to wait and find out. And perhaps, through this experience, I'll learn to strike a balance between the need for structure and the desire for spontaneity, between discipline and freedom, between certainty and the joy of the unknown.\n",

      "I finally got to watch Matrix: Revolutions. I don't get why everyone says it's terrible. It's interesting how people who loved the second movie hated the third, while those who didn't like the second loved the third. I'm in the latter group. I've been pondering why this happens. It might be about expectations. I adored the first one and eagerly awaited the second, as I knew they were making a trilogy. I had high hopes for Reloaded and went to see it on opening night, only to be let down. Interestingly, X-Men 2 came out about a month before that. I liked the first one, but wasn't eagerly waiting for the sequel like I was for Reloaded. My expectations were practically nonexistent. I hadn't really thought about what to expect. When I saw it, I was blown away. After an hour and a half, I checked my friend's watch, worried it would end soon.\n",

      "Enough about the Matrix. I just returned from Vegas and saw David Copperfield. It might be intriguing to analyze his work from a psychological perspective, being an \"illusionist.\" I figured out one of his tricks, possibly because I'm skilled in visual media. Maybe it's because I've seen all those behind-the-scenes documentaries for the extended versions of Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. It's kind of ruined the tricks filmmakers use. Maybe it would have been better to stay ignorant and enjoy movies on the surface. I had a point about Copperfield. It was fun. I noticed his show used a lot of technological \"illusions,\" like video footage and complex audio-visual cues. It might have been better if I hadn't known how simple some of his tricks were. The older audience members must have been baffled.\n",

      "Kenji is adorable. He's finally decided to settle down for the next hour, maybe. Whenever I'm on the computer, he sleeps on my CD book to stay close, but now he's chosen a spot to the left instead of the right. That's a big difference! Before I moved the computer to its current spot, it was closer to the bed on Ryan's desk. Kenji used to spend his time on the corner of my bed—sorry, Amanda's bed. I still can't believe when I talked to her (a rare occasion since the Kerry people have been working her to the bone since she moved out and I took her old apartment) and I was so excited about buying this silky linen for, and I quote, \"my bed.\" \"You mean MY bed,\" she said. \"I bought it. You're just keeping the things in that apartment while I'm gone working on the campaign.\" That's nonsense. When we were kids, do you think we'd say to our friends, \"Oh, I have to go now. I need to go to my mom's bed,\" or what I should call my mom's bed, because she bought it even though I sleep in it every night? That's ridiculous! She's just being possessive because she likes to identify herself as financially independent. I hope she'll get over it because I really resent the idea that she thinks everything in this apartment belongs to her. For some reason, that really bugs me. Kenji's awake now, making it hard to type because he's trying to claw the keyboard. My time's up anyway, so that's all for now!\n",

      "I'm 18 and just started college. So far, it's been a bit underwhelming, and I haven't even gotten my math book yet, which is really frustrating. It's not the end of the world, but it's definitely not ideal. I wanted to watch a show on TV, but I guess I won't, so I'm just sitting here thinking. The dryer is making a lot of noise, and it's only been 2 minutes since I started typing this nonsense. School is really tiring, and I take naps almost every day. I actually enjoy writing about nothing because it gives me the freedom to choose what to write about. I was thinking about describing a smell, but there's nothing interesting in the air right now. About an hour ago, I had some meatloaf that my brother made, and it was pretty good. Now I'm hungry again because I didn't eat much, so I'm thinking of heading to Starbucks for a Mocha Frappuccino. I always forget if it's spelled with one or two 'c's. Before I go to Starbucks, I might hit the gym, but not the one at UT because it's too far and I have other stuff to do. I wonder what time Starbucks closes. I also want some ice cream. I really hope I don't gain the Freshman 15 because that would be a bummer. I hope this doesn't offend anyone who has to read this; it's not my intention. I need to learn to manage my time better, and soon. My throat is bothering me, and I wish I could just sleep all day. I hate some of my classes, especially being in the Gateway Program. It's not what I expected, and I didn't think I'd have to take a class for it. I feel out of place in the most boring classroom. I wonder if I can drop out of the program without upsetting the Coordinator. When should I even try to get out? I have 6 more minutes to fill. What should I talk about? Oh, I had a fever last week, and I hope I don't get sick again this year. Another thing about the Gateway program is that I have to attend social events, which takes up a lot of my time. I don't know what to do. They helped me register, and now I have to wait 3 hours and 30 minutes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays before my last class, which is Psychology. I get really sleepy during that class. Sorry, 2 more minutes. I'm looking at this sheet and have no idea what to do with my UT email address or how to access it. Does that make me dumb? I wonder if I'll get a response to that question. Yeah, 9 more seconds.\n",

      "Tonight was a pretty eventful evening for me. I had a great time at the Phi Lamb meeting and got to meet some of the members, including Laura, who was really nice. I'm excited to get to know her better. I'm also curious to find out who my big sister in the organization will be - I've always loved having a big sister figure in my college experiences. Interestingly, I was just talking to my big sister from the drill team I was part of in high school, which brought back some memories. Although it's nice to have a big sister figure, my own sister can be a bit challenging to get along with. I've decided that when I have kids, I want them to be close in age, so they can grow up together. It's crazy to think that in just ten years, I'll probably be married with kids of my own. I'm actually really excited about the prospect of being a mom - my own mom was an amazing influence on me, even if she sometimes had some... let's say, interesting views on life. I'm looking forward to seeing her this weekend, especially since she got us tickets to a game, which is really cool. It's amazing how quickly campus has started to feel like home, and I'm glad I'm adjusting so well to living here. It's a good thing, since I'll be here for the next four years. \n",

I miss him so much, and it's tough knowing we won't see each other until late October. I'm not sure if we'll make it through the next four years apart, but I know we can. I've always wanted to be with him, and he's the most amazing guy I've ever met. Sometimes, though, I get scared about what the future holds for us. I wish we could be closer, but at the same time, it's good that we're apart, since it lets me experience life on my own while still having his love and support just a phone call away. If we were together, we might spend too much time together, and that wouldn't be good for either of us - I need to explore myself and figure out who I am in college. \n",

I've never been a big fan of his before, but this song is really relaxing. I'm looking forward to hearing his song number four, which is my favorite, or the one playing now, which I'm enjoying too. It's funny how music can relate to our emotions, and this song definitely resonates with me, given our long-distance situation. I wish I had a TV to distract me from my computer and instant messaging, but for now, I'm just enjoying the music and my thoughts. Tomorrow is Thursday, which means my classes will be more challenging, and I have a lot of homework to do. I'm glad I'm used to being an overachiever, as it will help me navigate the college workload. I'm looking forward to the weekend, though - I get to go out on a boat on Friday and then watch a UT game on Saturday, which should be an amazing experience.

      "I had a close call this morning when I almost missed my Philosophy discussion group at 12. I had planned to sleep in after a night out, but luckily my roommate, who's also in the class, reminded me. It's funny, I've never spent a night alone in our room since I moved in, but that's about to change. This weekend, my roommates will be away, and I'll be sticking around for a sorority event and retreat. I'm not thrilled about it, but I'm used to having the place to myself from time to time. What's weird is that I've only been here for three weeks, so the thought of being alone in the room feels a bit strange. On a separate note, I'm currently on the phone with the Health Center because I woke up with a swollen eye, which is pretty annoying. It's not painful, just a dull discomfort. Something else that's been on my mind is my friend, who's also my date for the upcoming OU game. He recently left his fraternity, which I respected him for, but then I saw him wearing their pledge outfit again, which raised some concerns. I think he might be feeling a bit lonely since his friends aren't around, and that's why he's considering going back. I'm not sure what to make of it, but we'll see how things play out.\n",

I spent my first year at Stephen F. Austin, and while I enjoyed it, I think it was more about the town than the school itself. I'm glad I'm in Austin now, surrounded by old friends, but I'm still finding my footing. I'm not studying as much as I should, which makes me feel a bit inadequate, inefficient, and worthless. However, I don't dwell on those feelings; instead, I focus on the joys of having my own place.

I used to work for Vector, selling Cutco, attending conventions to meet folks from across the nation, only to lose touch afterward. People seem to drift apart more than they should. I'm making an effort to maintain friendships, but it's not always easy. My throat is parched right now. I might head up for a drink, but I don't think we're allowed, so I'll stick with this. I've put things off long enough. I could use a boost in motivation, and a computer wouldn't hurt. I'm exploring this computer lab at Jester for the first time, and it's a bit of a buzzkill - I'm parched and the email stuff is a mystery. I'm thinking it for later after I wrap this up.

My arm's getting tired from the awkward writing space, and I need a break. There's still time to write, but I could use a drink. A computer would make life easier, no doubt. I should visit my dog before the neighbors decide he's theirs again. They tried an ultimatum, whatever that is. He's my dog, no need for their fancy talk.

No window for the full view, like being in a dungeon. Plants were out, too. Not enough light. If only a storm would hit, the storms are soothing. My parents' house project takes forever, but the porch lets you watch rain. Friends at Southwest, thinking about Kate's garden and how lovely it would look post-rain.

If I wait until this is over, I might be stuck with nothing else to do tonight until 11:30, so maybe getting index cards now isn't the best idea.

My boyfriend is the reason why I worry so much. We've been together, and I've seen him go through various phases, but I've never seen him as unhappy as he is now. The reason I worry is that I want the best for him, not our relationship, but him. He never tries to eat what I cook; even the dishes I make are \"decent.\" Sometimes, it makes me feel like he's not appreciative of my efforts. It's not that he's condescending, but that's how he acts. We have our disagreements; he always tells me what he wants, but he never truly appreciates what I give to him. His mind seems to be clouded with negative thoughts, which makes him respond negatively. What I wish is that if he genuinely liked something, he wouldn't think negatively about it.

On the bright side, I've been pretty good about my diet – I ate a lot of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese for dinner. I know it's not the healthiest option, but it's full of calcium, and I do a lot of walking. So, I shouldn't be too hard on myself about it. As for me wanting to grab a Coke, it's just a habit I have. It's so bubbly, and I love the taste, but I'm aware that it's not the best for my health. Maybe if I can get some sleep tonight, I'll be able to focus on other things. It's been a long day – I had four classes, and I'm exhausted. What made things worse was that a huge spider was on my shirt while I was waiting for the bus. I freaked out and almost cried. I hate spiders. It's not just bugs, but spiders are my worst phobia. I just want to get through this assignment now, so I can move on with my life.

      "\"I often wonder if I'm making the right choice by going to this university. I had chances to attend other places, but I decided to stay close to home. My parents have always had their own ideas and basically decided my major for me. When I tried to change it, they got upset and barely spoke to me, which upset me too. I want to follow their advice, but if it doesn't interest me or causes me stress, why should I? In the end, I chose what felt best for me and made the switch. Sometimes I wonder about how smart some people are and why others struggle even when they put in so much effort. I see students working really hard to get an A in a class where it seems the smartest person barely has to study and still gets a higher grade than those who worked extra hard. One thing that confuses me is girls sometimes. They can seem like they're in their own world, and even when you try to be nice, they might look at you like you're the dumbest person ever! I wish they would open up more to guys, not just their girlfriends. They should share things with guy friends as easily as they do with girls. Why are the Astros such a disappointment this year? They were a strong team, and now they're playing like a group of high school players. They were favorites at the start of the season and are now at the bottom of their division. It doesn't make sense, especially for such a talented team. The Rockets also need to improve next year. They didn't sign any free agents this summer, which really hurt their chances. If they want to be good again, they need to sign some talented players. I also get frustrated because some teachers don't tell us what will be on exams. It would be easier to study if we knew, but they make us cover everything, even the unimportant stuff. One thing I really enjoy about this university are the girls. They're incredibly attractive, and I'm convinced that the right one will be mine one day.\" \n",

      "Man, I have to do this writing assignment. What a waste of time. I could be sleeping right now. I am so tired. Stupid 8:00 classes. I don't want to go to class anymore. That door is really loud. I wonder if the cleaning woman is done cleaning the bathroom. I really have to go. Oh well, I can wait 20 minutes. I wonder why 20 minutes is so relative to this assignment. Sigh. I can't think of anything to type. Pretty blank right now. What's on TV? Looks like some big guy doing a hefty exercise. OH MY GOD! That guy's huge! Picking up kegs. That's strength, right there. I wish I was that strong. That would be really cool. Too bad it takes forever to develop that. All that working out at the gym. That's a nice looking road. Oh, Union Pacific. Oh, Lindsay's responding to my AIM. She fell asleep. Figures. She's always tired. Why am I so bitter about this breakup? I mean we said we were going to be friends. If we're friends, then why do I find myself mad at her all the time? I think she doesn't like being around me anymore, despite what she says. Girls are so complicated. She could at least be up front about it if she didn't want to hang out anymore. I think this whole ordeal is destroying our chances of getting back together. Whatever. I miss her though. Or is it her that I really miss? Maybe I just miss having a girlfriend. Someone to hold and appreciate. I wonder if. What are you talking about Josh? Whatever. Where was I? Oh yeah, girlfriends. World's strongest man. Raise your hand, you know it. Raise your hand. Damn, this TV's too loud. I can't think. Raise your hand. 100 percent. If you're sure. Chicken tenders. Kick out of dinner tonight. Tonight on Sports Center. What makes relationships so complicated? I see my other friends who are couples and they appear to be fine. Steven and Katy look like they're in love with each other. That'll never last. Steven shouldn't be treated like that. And Katy needs someone more independent, not a lazy hobo. Whatever. At least they have a relationship. Man, Jeff's got it good. He just picks up girls so easily. People like to be around him. Plus he's got Erin back home he can go back to for some loving. I miss loving. Those were some good days. That's probably why things never worked out with Lindsay. She probably wanted something more in the relationship. But what? I always took her out on dates. Made her feel special. And I slip up one time on my birthday. Damn it. Why did I have to act that way? I hate when I do that. But one mistake was all it took for things to go sour. Pennebaker? Yeah, that's his name. Uh. Damn it! I'm so bitter. I really should cool down if I'm ever going to get back in another relationship. Who knows how long that'll be. There's a couple of girls in band. My gracious! They are hot! That would be some sweet loving there I must say. But then there's the guilt of Lindsay. There's a never-ending trap. What if she still wants back into the relationship? I know she told Sarah that it's a possibility later on this year, but should I really wait for her? Did she really mean that much to me? Of course she did, or I would've broken up with her a long time ago. But why do I feel differently now? What makes now so different than the past? I guess things get old over time, and changes must be made. Looks like I took the first step by breaking up. I guess I should just move on. We'll see. Oh, time's up. Oh but I can still write. Hmm. Well I guess I'm done. I want to sleep before band practice anyway. Man, why do we have to go off campus. They make things so difficult.\n",

      "I've been feeling like I'm falling behind in my courses, despite a promising start. My mom's decision to quit her job has me on edge, as the circumstances don't seem convincing after our previous experience with her job loss. I've caught myself doubting her explanations, which has left me feeling guilty for not believing her. Last night's stress and resulting frustration have left me feeling downcast and incapacitated. To cope, I try to maintain a positive attitude to keep my focus on studying, though typing on my computer often strains my eyes, leading to fatigue. Band practice tonight is enjoyable but consumes my entire evening. I regret overeating for lunch and now struggle with my fitness equipment being out of order. The coming week seems challenging, and I'm apprehensive about attending a party after the game due to potential tiredness. Tomorrow, I need to visit HEB for cash, a task I anticipate will be time-consuming. I aspire to read more tomorrow, although it's difficult during the day as I read better at night, risking late nights and exhaustion. Living away from home has its perks, like the serene picture on my wall that brings a touch of tranquility. However, I overslept today, but at least I'll make it to my 3:00 class. Missing classes due to tiredness is a frequent issue for me. The auditorium's seating arrangement often makes me feel trapped. I'm aiming to arrive early next time for a better spot, perhaps outside. The discovery of this computer lab has been a relief as I no longer need to travel to the UGL for computer access. Mozart's is on my agenda for tomorrow night, where I plan to grab coffee and study, hoping Jill will join. I've learned the hard way that I tend to forget computer-based assignments, a lesson from my previous year's struggles with Spanish coursework. Sapanish is a subject I find engaging, despite the mental effort required. I'm also noticing my hands getting tired. I wish my veins weren't so prominent on my hands. I appreciate iMacs for their aesthetic but acknowledge their size can be a drawback. I'm looking forward to laser eye surgery to eliminate the need for contacts or glasses.\n",

      "I'm back in town after a great week at band camp. I meant to post something while I was gone but every time that I had a chance to post I was to wound up to put all my thoughts together into a post. Band camp was incredible. There was no way that I could have imagined it to be as great as it was. I made a crap load of new friends, built stronger bonds with older friends, and found out that I don't need to deal with some of the stupidity from some of the people I use to call 'friends'. While I did all this I had a great time. So much to talk about but hard to put in words man but I will give it a shot... The trumpet section this year kicks butt. Sectionals were awesome. Swig, the trumpet instructor, was constructive to everyone as far as I'm concerned. I wish we could have had more sectionals this year but it seemed like we spent more time on the field then any other year. That was great but the music is as important in the individual sections just as much as the over all look of the band to me. The music is growing on me. I wasn't sure if I was going to even like it when we first got it but playing it for two weeks and having all of it memorized except for a couple of difficult measures it isn't as gay as I thought it was. The show is hard. It isn't impossible but it isn't easy either. I love it though because of how different it is compared to the past two year's shows. As long as Sara stands back and yells at me during the show to move over and such because I can't see behind me, it will be great. ;-) Let me continue rambling... The talent show was an experience. The highlight of the night has to be the golf ball Andrew sent flying into one of the over head lights in the lecture hall during the talent show. It was one of those moments that is hard to describe unless you were there to experience it. He was doing tricks with golf balls and a club and one of the last tricks he did was bounce the ball up in the air and hit it into the crowd. Well when he did that it went a little high and went straight into a glass over head light thing sending shattered glass cascading down all over Shannon and Tim about five feet away from me. I was worried about Shannon because she was pretty shaken up about it but she was okay. All the acts at the talent show were really good. There were seventeen to be exact, I think. Michelle and Bri and the other two girls that were with them were great. They did like a little skit thing to the song 'You Can't Hurry Love' and it was good. I was surprised by two of the performers- Irby and Stephan. Those two guys can sing man. Who would have guessed Irby could sing like he did!? That was great. The song that Collen sang for Ashley was awesome. The 'Intermission' that Mrs. Mann, my fourth period teacher for next school year!, put together that surprised Mr. Mac and Mr. Sanders was funny. 'I always knew my drum stick was bigger... yeah, but mine has fur.' I was rollin by then because It was so dang lame but it was still pretty funny. I could have gone without seeing Mr. Mac shoving that Fourth of July thing up his crack though. I wish I could remember everything from the talent show and who did what but I can't. Everyone was great and I hope next year's is as entertaining as this year's was. The luau was fun. Not much to talk about it though. We have a very attractive marching band when everyone is dressed up. lol The dance was 'off the chain.' (That quote is dedicated to the marching freshman class.) I was more sore after the dance then I was all week. It was so much fun. When everyone got in a circle and different people would get in the middle and do stuff, that was the best. Saye did the little disco thing with Jay and that was awesome. Shaun jumped in and started messing around. It was cool but bitter sweet. When they had the senior dance, that was when it got sort of depressing. It finally hit that it was our last night at band camp together as a group and it was sad. lol :fart: The food sucked. I didn't eat to much of it but from what I did eat of it I can tell you that it sucked. They are redoing the food services building and turning it into one of those high tech campus meeting places like they have at Emory for those of you who have seen Emory's food quart. Since they were redoing the food thing they didn't have any choices as to what to eat and the soda always tasted funny but it was band camp so it was all good. I have to do a shout out list now so hang tight- Michelle, Liz, Kourtney, William (watch out for the attacking Scrabble letters), Heather, Aaron, Steph, Elizabeth, I hate listing people because I always forget someone important that is really cool and I should remember but can't, the coolest group of people in the marching band, the trumpet section, Craig, Jay, Ryan, Alex, Stephan H., Stephan S., David, Sara, Jasmine, Justin, Corey, Adam, Anthony D., Shaun, Blake, and our instructor *Swyg. (*Correction for Dave! lol) And last and least, the two people that made me angry in five minute intervals Anthony W. and Starr. Let me know if I forgot anyone. I know some of the freshman and rookies I forgot to put up here because I am terrible with names so just let me know. I just took my camera to get it developed so I should have some pics of something up here soon. I know that they have some pics from camp at the  urlLink band website . You can see the dorms we stayed in the past two years  urlLink right here  as-well. That picture on the page for the dorm is a picture of where we have our luau Wednesday night. Taking pictures for me at band camp is annoying to me. Band camp is so great that trying to capture moments is hard. I could have easily stayed another week hands down if I could have done laundry and everyone stayed with me. I honeslty had nothing to complain about. It's band camp! Why complain about anything? It is a thing you only get to experience as a student, if all goes well, four times in your life and it goes by so fast. Well, I'm getting tired of being online all the time so I am leaving as soon as I finish this conversation with one of the coolest people I have  ever  meet. No joke and I don't think they know it either. Peace.\n",

      "I honestly have no earthly idea. I just woke up about 2 hours ago. Drop off my younger sister at her school, which is my old high school. My boyfriend is still a senior there. At times it is awkward going there but at the same time very comfortable. I brought my (old) teacher  a lot of buckets for the upcoming carnival for the little kids. I enjoy bringing her to school 1, because I remember how horrible bus rides were. So I never rode it. Actually I rode it 2yrs in middle school, because my mom could not drop me off. And secondly I get to see my Bert. It is weird being in a relationship, not because it is uncomfortable. More like it is a different experience. I never really had a relationship until my senior year. It really isn't hard balancing my priorities. My number one priority is finishing school. Hey, I realized that my typing isn't as bad as I thought. I still have to look at the keys at times. Back to Bert. He really is an extremely wonderful person, cute, good husband material( not that I am thinking about that right now) It's just that it really is hard to find someone genuinely nice and sincere to everyone, and especially you. I think it just sucks that he is my first true relationship. Because, the old notion that the first most likely isn't the last. Only time will tell. It's about 10:02 and I didn't go to work today. Instead, I am doing this lovely assignment. Excuse my typing, I am not that good. Oh, I know what else I am thinking. My big 18 B-Day is coming up, and my dad is still holding strict control over me. Like I am twelve all over again. He doesn't realize that I am growing up and staying home this year doesn't help. Although, I love my home and mother. I only wish certain straining attitudes would alter. My first class today is math 305G. oh, boy! My teacher is actually, pretty nice. Right now it  is much more of a review, and my homework assignment is due today also. There were only actually a few problems that I quite couldn't recall. I just have to practice on more problems. I am not at all surprised of my needed review. The problems were wonderful word problems which I have never seemed to master without practice. Well look here it is three minutes past my 20 minutes. and these people are becoming a little antsy (I think that is how you spell it) about time limits. Oh, if you actually do read any parts of these assignment  I HOPE YOU ARE READING THIS BECAUSE I JUST WAS THINKING THAT YOUR CLASS IS ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE. AND I HOPE TO MEET ONE DAY NEXT WEEK, INSTEAD OF BEING A NUMBER IN YOUR 50000000 PERSON CLASS. (JUST A LITTLE PLAY WITH NUMBERS) Adios, till we meet again for the next writing assignment. Which I'll do tomorrow, because we can't do 2 in one day. Bye                            WRITING ASSIGNMENT 1                             433613201 \n",
