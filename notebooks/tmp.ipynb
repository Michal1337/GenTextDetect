Contents ( hide ) 1 History 2 Example of use 3 Related signs 4 See also 5 References History ( edit ) According to Cajori , A History of Mathematical Notations , Johann Rahn used both the therefore and because signs to mean `` therefore '' ; in the German edition of Teutsche Algebra ( 1659 ) the therefore sign was prevalent with the modern meaning , but in the 1668 English edition Rahn used the because sign more often to mean `` therefore '' . Other authors in the eighteenth century also used three dots in a triangle shape to signify `` therefore , '' but as with Rahn , there was n't much in the way of consistency as to how the triangle was oriented ; because with its current meaning appears to have originated in the nineteenth century . In this century , the three - dot notation for therefore became very rare in continental Europe , but it remains popular in the British Isles . Example of use ( edit ) Used in a syllogism : All gods are immortal . Zeus is a god . ∴ Zeus is immortal . x + 1 = 6 ∴ x = 5 Related signs ( edit ) A diploma from the Masonic Grande Loge de France showing the symbol as a substitute for the dot of abbreviation . The inverted form ∵ , known as the because sign , is sometimes used as a shorthand form of `` because '' . This is Unicode character U + 2235 . The therefore sign is sometimes used as a substitute for an asterism ⁂ . In meteorology , the therefore sign is used to indicate moderate rain on a station model ; the asterism indicates moderate snow . To denote logical implication or entailment , various signs are used in mathematical logic : → , ⇒ , ⊃ , ⊢ , ⊨ . These symbols are then part of a mathematical formula , and are not considered to be punctuation . In contrast , the therefore sign is traditionally used as a punctuation mark , and does not form part of a logical formula . The graphically identical sign ∴ serves as a Japanese map symbol on the maps of the Geographical Survey Institute of Japan , indicating a tea plantation . On other maps the sign , often with thicker dots , is sometimes used to signal the presence of a national monument or ruins . The character ஃ in the Tamil script represents the āytam , a special sound of the Tamil language . In Masonic traditions the symbol is used for abbreviation , instead of the usual period . For example `` R ∴ W ∴ John Smith '' is an abbreviation for `` Right Worshipful John Smith '' ( the term Right Worshipful is an archaic title just as `` Land Lord '' is and indicates that Brother Smith is a Grand Lodge officer ) . In Norwegian and Danish , a similar symbol is used as an explanatory symbol ( forklaringstegnet ) . It can be typeset using the open o followed by a colon , thus : ɔ : . It is used for the meaning `` namely '' , `` id est '' , `` scilicet '' or similar . See also ( edit ) Q.E.D. Mathematical jargon References ( edit ) Jump up ^ `` Cajori , vol. 1 , p. 211 '' .
